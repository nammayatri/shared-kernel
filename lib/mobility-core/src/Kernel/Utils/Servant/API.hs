-- | This behaves similarly to ':>' from API point of view, but in implementation
-- it attaches a parameter to /each/ separate endpoint, not /all/ of them at once.
--
-- For instance:
-- @
-- type API = Header "auth" Text :> (Get '[JSON] Text :<|> Post '[JSON] ())
-- @
--
-- requires the following implementation:
--
-- @
-- handlers :: Server API
-- handlers = \auth -> get auth :<|> new auth
-- @
--
-- But when ':>' is replaced with ':>|', you can write just
--
-- @
-- handlers = get :<|> auth
-- @
--
-- Note that ':>|' has fewer priority that ':<|>' so you can omit parentheses.
--
-- This operator is experimental, if you find ':>' more appropriate then use it.
